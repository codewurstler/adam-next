                        own content on these pages according to the general laws pursuant to Art. 13 of the Swiss Federal

                        Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no
                        influence.
                        Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
                        operator of
                        the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked
                        for possible
                        legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of
                        linking. However,
                        a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence
                        of a
                        violation of the law. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links
                        immediately.
